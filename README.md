# Coursera Cloud Foundation
In this repository lies my journey in the cloud foundation course in coursera. This is hosted by Duke University and the first course in the Building Cloud Computing Solutions at Scale Specialization! In this course, I will learn how to build foundational Cloud computing infrastructure, including websites involving serverless technology and virtual machines. I will also learn how to apply Agile software development techniques to projects which will be useful in building portfolio projects and global-scale Cloud infrastructures.
